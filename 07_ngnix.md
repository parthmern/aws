### nginx

- assume that on your ec2 machine you are running 2 servers/services on port 8080 and 8081
- what i can do is i am running something else on port 80 which can decide that if the incoming url is backend1.com then send request on 8080 and if url is backend2.com then send request on 8081 and thar something else between thing is called as reverse proxy

- ( generally by default your public ip for machine is running on port 80)
